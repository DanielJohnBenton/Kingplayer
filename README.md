- Simulate 'Three for a King' with 2-52 multiple players
- Count 'place counts' (number of times a card was placed on the pile) - effectively measuring game length
- Find high and low length games using many plays of shuffled decks
- Show distributions of game length using graphs
- Find high and low length games using a genetic algorithm to evolve a starting deck
