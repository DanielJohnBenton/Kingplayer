# :hearts: About _Three for a King_

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggar-my-neighbour):

```
A standard 52-card deck is divided equally between two players, and
the two stacks of cards are placed on the table face down. The first
player lays down his top card face up, and the opponent plays his top
card, also face up, on it, and this goes on alternately as long as no
ace or face card (king, queen, or jack) appears. These cards are
called "penalty cards."

If either player turns up such a card, his opponent has to pay a penalty:
four cards for an ace, three for a king, two for a queen, or one for a jack.
When he has done so, the player of the penalty card wins the hand,
takes all the cards in the pile and places them under his pack.
The game continues in the same fashion, the winner having the advantage
of placing the first card.
However, if the second player turns up another ace or face card in the
course of paying to the original penalty card, his payment ceases and
the first player must pay to this new card. This changing of
penalisation can continue indefinitely. The hand is lost by the player
who, in playing his penalty, turns up neither an ace nor a face card.
Then, his opponent acquires all of the cards in the pile. When a
single player has all of the cards in the deck in his stack, he has won.
